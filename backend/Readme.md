**What We're Building:**
We're creating a comprehensive file management system for an NGO's accounting and financial documents. The system needs to:
1. Handle various types of financial documents (Excel, PDF)
2. Organize files by categories (Income Statements, Cash Flow, etc.)
3. Support multiple file uploads
4. Allow file viewing and downloading
5. Maintain proper organization and tracking
6. Support different departments and projects
7. Handle archiving and versioning

**High-Level Backend Structure:**

1. **Models** (`/models`):
   - `File.js`: Defines the structure for all uploaded files
     - Tracks file metadata, categories, departments, projects
     - Handles versioning and archiving
     - Supports multiple file types
   - `Category.js`: Manages document categories
     - Defines different types of financial documents
     - Handles sub-categories
     - Manages retention periods

2. **Controllers** (`/controllers`):
   - `fileController.js`: Handles all file operations
     - Upload/download files
     - Search and filter files
     - Update file metadata
     - Archive/restore files
   - `categoryController.js`: Manages categories
     - Create/update categories
     - Initialize default categories
     - Handle sub-categories

3. **Routes** (`/routes`):
   - `files.js`: Defines all file-related endpoints
     - Upload endpoints
     - Search and filter endpoints
     - File operation endpoints
   - `categories.js`: Defines category management endpoints
     - Category CRUD operations
     - Category management endpoints

4. **Middleware** (`/middleware`):
   - `upload.js`: Handles file uploads
     - Validates file types
     - Manages file storage
     - Handles multiple file uploads
     - Organizes files in structured directories

5. **Config** (`/config`):
   - `db.js`: MongoDB connection configuration
     - Handles database connection
     - Manages connection errors

6. **Server** (`server.js`):
   - Main application setup
   - Middleware configuration
   - Route registration
   - Error handling
   - Directory structure management
   - Health monitoring

**How Your Backend Handles Requests:**

1. **File Upload Flow:**
   ```
   Request → Middleware (upload.js) → File Controller → Database
   ```
   - Validates file type and size
   - Organizes files in proper directories
   - Stores metadata in database
   - Returns file information

2. **File Retrieval Flow:**
   ```
   Request → Route → File Controller → Database → Response
   ```
   - Can filter by category, date, department
   - Supports searching and sorting
   - Handles file downloads

3. **Category Management Flow:**
   ```
   Request → Route → Category Controller → Database → Response
   ```
   - Manages document categories
   - Handles sub-categories
   - Maintains organization structure

**Key Features:**
1. **File Management:**
   - Multiple file uploads (up to 10 files)
   - Large file support (up to 50MB)
   - Organized storage structure
   - Version control
   - Archiving system

2. **Organization:**
   - Category-based organization
   - Department-based filtering
   - Project-based organization
   - Date-based organization

3. **Security:**
   - File type validation
   - Size limits
   - Error handling
   - Secure file serving

4. **Flexibility:**
   - Custom metadata support
   - Tag system
   - Multiple file types
   - Extensible category system
